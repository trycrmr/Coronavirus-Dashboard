                            2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus)
                            identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan,
                            China.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link
                            to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal
                            markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The name coronavirus is derived from the Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "halo", which
                            refers to the characteristic appearance reminiscent of a crown.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The main route of transmission is respiratory droplets and close contact.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When you sneeze or cough, you send out droplets of fluid from your nose and mouth.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Those droplets can carry infections, and when they enter someone else's enter the eyes, nose
                            or mouth, the infection can make them sick. This is the way the flu and many viruses are
                            spread.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Most often, you need to be close to the person (within 6 feet) for it to spread this way.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There is the possibility of aerosol transmission when exposed to high concentration aerosol
                            for a long time in a relatively closed environment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The WHO has stated that the risk of spread from someone without symptoms is "very low" and
                            that fecal transmission is "low".

                            The use of surgical masks by those who may be infected has also been recommended, as they

                            There is no evidence to show that the wearing of surgical masks by uninfected people at low
                            risk is effective.

                            Only China has specifically recommended the use of masks by healthy members of the public,
                            while face masks have been widely used by healthy people in Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, and

                            Wear a mask if you are <em>coughing</em> or <em>sneezing</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Before putting on a mask, clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cover your mouth and nose with the mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face
                            and the mask.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid touching the mask while using it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use masks.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To remove the mask, remove it from behind (do not touch the front of the mask), discard it
                            immediately in a closed bin, and then clean your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap
                            and water.

                            Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who

                            Public health agencies have issued self-isolation instructions that include notification of

                            getting medical care.
